# Social_network_app
The app developed by me to learn basically how Google Firebase works .i.e. how we can store and retrieve data from firebase realtime database.This app is something similar to Instagram in which firstly we will login/register our account and than we can add our posts and all those users who use this app can see that posts and also they can add their own posts also.This app also contains a feature of sending friend request to the users and than we can also send messages to each other.
